# PropsBot #


## A Slackbot for props ##


PropsBot is an awesome robot that monitors the public channels of any team Slack server. When you want to give Albrey some props, you just have to type `albrey++` and PropsBot will incriment his current points.

## Problem ##
There is currently no easy way to give props to someone. High fives are cool, but it's hard to keep track of the number you've racked up over the past few days, and without that number, how will you know how cool you are?

## Solution ##
PropsBot takes all the guess work out of who did the awesomest stuff. People can give points to people who made coffee, brought donuts, helped them with a problem, or made a cool slack bot.

## Quote from the CEO ##

## How to Get Started ##
Just plug PropsBot into your slack channel and props away!

## Customer Quote ##
  > I never knew what love was until the day I got PropsBot.
